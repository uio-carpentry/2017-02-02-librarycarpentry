  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.
-->

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>
  To participate in a Software Carpentry workshop, you will need
  access to the software described below. In addition, you will
  need an up-to-date web browser.
</p>
<p>
  We maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors
  that may be useful on the
  <a href = "{{site.swc_github}}/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions">Configuration Problems and Solutions wiki page</a>.
</p>

<div id="openrefine">
  <h3>OpenRefine</h3>

  <p>
    OpenRefine is a tool for cleaning up and transforming data.
  </p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="openrefine-windows">Windows</h4>
      <p>
        Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is required to run OpenRefine. If using a UiO
        computer, please install JRE from <a href="https://software.uio.no/">Software Center</a>.
        Otherwise, please install JRE from Oracle at
        <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html">this site</a>.
        Check "Accept License Agreement",
        then download the "Windows x64 Offline" file from the list
        (<em>jre-8u121-windows-x64.exe</em>)
      </p>
      <p>
        Install <em>OpenRefine 2.6-rc2 Release Candidate 2 Windows Kit</em> by downloading
        <a href="https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases/download/2.6-rc.2/openrefine-win-2.6-rc.2.zip">this .zip file</a>
        from <a href="http://openrefine.org/download.html">OpenRefine</a> and
        extracting it. Once extracted, you might want to move the folder to your "Program files"
        folder for consistency, but you can also leave it where it is.
        Apart from that there is no installation.
        Check that you can start OpenRefine by opening "openrefine.exe". If not working,
        you can try "refine.bat" instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: OpenRefine recommends using Chrome or Firefox over Internet Explorer.
        We therefore recommend having Chrome or Firefox installed.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="openrefine-macosx">Mac OS X</h4>
      <p>
        Install <em>OpenRefine 2.6-rc2 Release Candidate 2 Mac Kit</em> by downloading
        <a href="https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases/download/2.6-rc.2/openrefine-mac-2.6-rc.2.dmg">this file</a> from <a href="http://openrefine.org/download.html">OpenRefine</a>, open it and,
        then drag and drop OpenRefine into Applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Open Refine requires Java Runtime Environment (JRE), but the Mac Kit includes this,
        so a separate installation should not be necessary.)
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="openrefine-linux">Linux</h4>
      <p>
        Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is required to run OpenRefine. In most
        cases, it's best to use your package manager to install this. E.g.
        <code>sudo apt-get install default-jre</code> on recent Ubuntu distributions,
        or <code>yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk</code> on recent CentOS distributions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Install <em>OpenRefine 2.6-rc2 Release Candidate 2 Linux Kit</em> by downloading

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="shell-macosx">Mac OS X</h4>
      <p>
        The default shell in all versions of Mac OS X is Bash, so no
        need to install anything.  You access Bash from the Terminal
        (found in
        <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>).
        See the Git installation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LQhwETCdwY ">video tutorial</a>
        for an example on how to open the Terminal.
        You may want to keep

    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="shell-linux">Linux</h4>
      <p>
        The default shell is usually Bash, but if your
        machine is set up differently you can run it by opening a
        terminal and typing <code>bash</code>.  There is no need to
        install anything.

  <h3>Text Editor</h3>

  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this particular workshop we won't be using a text editor in any of the
    sessions. A good text editor is still an important tool in the toolbox of
    any software carpenter, so there's no reason not to install one.
  </p>
  <p>
    Editors you can try are <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>
    (Windows) or <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>
    (Windows, Mac, Linux).

  <h3>Virtual Machine</h3>

  <p>
    Some instructors prefer to have learners use a virtual machine (VM)
    rather than install software on their own computers.  If your
    instructors have chosen to do this, please:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>.

    <li>
      Download our <a href="{{site.swc_vm}}">VM image</a>.
      <strong>Warning:</strong> this file is 1.7 GByte, so please
      download it <em>before</em> coming to your workshop.
